"Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ? ",directive

" That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . ",directive
 It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it . ,commissive
" It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . ",directive
 But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . ,commissive

 It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . ,commissive

 I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . ,commissive
 You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . ,directive
